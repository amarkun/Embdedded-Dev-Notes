BJT = Bipolar junction transistor
	- a type of transistor that uses both electron and hole charge carriers (FET use only one type of charge carrier
	- use two conjuncitions between to semiconductor types, n-type and p-type
	- main functionality is to amplify signals; can be used as amplifiers or switches
CAN = Controller Area Network
	- robust vehicle bus designed to allow microcontrollers to communicate with each other in applications without a host computer
CISC = Commples Instruction Set Computer
	- a computer in which single instructions can execute several low-level opperations (load from memory, arithmetic, memory store) or are capable of multi-step operations or addressing modes with single instructions.
	- coined in contract to RISC
CMOS = Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
	- a technology for constructing integrated circuits
	- high noise immunity and low static power consumption (only uses significant power duirng on/off switching)
	- allows high density of logic functions on a chip
Dhrystone
	- a synthetic computing benchmark program representative of general processory (CPU) performance
	- developed in 1984 intended to be representative of system (integer) programming
DMIPS = Dhrystone MIPS (Million Instructions per Second)
	- a measure of computer performance relative to the performance of the DEC VAX 11/780 minicomputer of the 1970s
DRAM - Dynamic Random-Access Memory
	- a type of random access semiconductor memory that stores each bit of data is a separate tiny capacitory within an integrated circuit
	- capacitor can be charged or discharged to represent the two states of a bit
	- requires memory refresh as the charge of the capacitors slowly leaks off
	- exhibits data remanence, but is volatile
	- slower and less expensive than SRAM
	- used for a computer's main memory
DSP = Digitla Signal Processor
	- a specialized microprocessor ( or a SIP block) with architecture optimized for the operational needs of digital signal processing
	- usually used to measure, filter, or compress real world-analog signals
	- often a challenge for general microprocessors to keep up with processing continuously in real-time
	- usually have better battery power efficiency than general microprocessors
	- often use special memory architectures to fetch multiple data or instructions simultaneously
FET = Filed-effect transistor
	- an electronic device which uses an electric field to control the flow of current
	- 3-terminalled devices (source, gate, drain)
	- application of a voltage to the gate terminal alters conductivity between the drain and source terminals
Flash memory
	- non-volatile storage
FSMC = flexible static memory control
	- used for storing data in a volatile configuration...
FPU = Floating-point Unit
	- a math coprocessor that is part of a computer sysmem that is specially designed to carry out operations on floating point numbers
IC = Integrated Circuit
	- a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or "chip") of semiconductor material that is normally silicon
IC power-supply pin
	- pins used in nearly all ICs that connect to the power rails of the circuit in which they are installe
ISA = Instruction set architecture
	- an abstract model of a computer
	- a realization of an ISA is an implementaion
MMC = MultiMediaCard
	- memory card used for solid-state storage
MMU = Memory Management Unit
	- aka PMMU = Paged Memroy Management Unit
	- computer hardware unit having all memory references passed throygh itself
	- primarily performs the translation of virtual memory addresses to physical addresses
	- effectively performs memory management while simultaneously handling memory protection, cache control, bus arbitration and, sometimes, bank switching
MPU* = Memory Protection Unit
	- a computer hardware unit that provides memory protection
	- usually implemented as part of the CPU
	- usually managed by an RTOS
	- trimmed down version of MMU that only offers memory protection
	- usually implemented in low power processors that require only memory protection
PLL = phase-locked-loop
	- control system that generates and output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an output signal.
RISC = Reduced instruction set somputer
	- a computer whose ISA allows it to have fewer cycles per instruction than a CISC
RTC = real-time-clock
	- clock that tracks current time
RTOS = Real-time Operating System
	- an OS intended to serve real-time applications that process data as it comes in, typically without buffer delays
SDIO = Secure Digital Input Output
	- an extention of the SD (a non-volatile memroy card) specificaaiton to cover I/O functions
SRAM = Static Random-Access Memory
	- type of semiconductor memory that uses bistable latching circuitry (flip-flop) to store each bit
	- exhibits data remanence, but is still volatile
	- opposed to DRAM, which must be periodically refreshed
	- faster & more expensive than DRAM
	- typically used for a CPU cache
USB OTG = USB on-the-go
	- specification that allows usb devices to operate as hosts for other USB devices
Vehicle Bus
	- a specialized internal communications network that interconnects components inside a vehicle
VDD
	- a positive IC power-supply pin on field-effect transistor-based integrated circuits
VSS
	- a negative IC power-supply pin on field-effect transistor-based integrated circuits
