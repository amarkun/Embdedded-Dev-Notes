	- two systems baud clocks can be up to 5% off

ULPI = UTMI Low-Pin Interface
	- defines an interface between USB IP link controllers and the PHYs or transceivers that drive the actual bus
	- designed specifically to reduce the pin count of discrete high-speed USB PHYs
USART = Universal Synchronous and Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter
	- type of serial bus that can be programmed to communicate asynchronously or synchronously
	- in synchronous mode:
		- transmits data in frames
		- characters must be provided on time until a frame is complete
		- "underrun error" if this is not done by the processor -> transition frame is aborted
		- character-oriented
			+ STR and BSC
			+ relied on particular characters to define frame boundaries
		- bit-oriented
			+ HDLC and SDLC
			+ earlier devices relied on physical-layer signals
			+ later devices took over the physical-layered recognition of bit patterns
		- synchronous line is never silent: modem transmitting = data flowing
		- when physical layer indicates modem is active, USART sends steady stream of padding (either characters or bits)
	- lines:
		- RX	: Receiving Line
		- TX	: Transfer Line
		- Clock	: clock used to synchronize the devices (square baud wave)
		- CTS	: Clear To Send flow control signal
		- RTS	: Ready to Send flow control signal
	- flow control signals used to throttle data flow
	- CTS connected to RTS of other machine
	- aka Hardware Handshaking
US HS = USB High-speed
	- a mode of USB signal transmission using differential signaling on a twisted-pair data cable
	- mode uses same wire pair, but with different electrical conventions
	- see Wikipedia for voltage details

USB OTG = USB on-the-go
	- specification that allows usb devices to operate as hosts for other USB devices
UTMI = USB 2.0 Transceiver Macrocell Interface
_V_
Vehicle Bus
	- a specialized internal communications network that interconnects components inside a vehicle
VDD
	- a positive IC power-supply pin on field-effect transistor-based integrated circuits
VIH = Voltage Input High
	- Voltage at which an input signal to the processor is declared high
VIL = Voltage Input Low
	- Voltage at which an input signal to the processor is declared low
VSS
	- a negative IC power-supply pin on field-effect transistor-based integrated circuits
_W_
Watchdog Timer
	- an electronic timer that is used to detect and recover from computer malfunctions
	- MES: might reset processor if no action is performed (e.g. toggle of an I/O line or register write)
	- MES: system will wait for a processor signal that things are going well
Wire Wrap
	- wire connections made by wrapping several turns of uninsulated sections of wire around component lead or socket pin
	- invented to wire telephone crossbar switches
	- later adapted to construct electronic circuit boards
